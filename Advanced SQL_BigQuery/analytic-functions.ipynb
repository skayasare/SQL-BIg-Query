    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [Intro to SQL micro-course](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-sql), you learned how to use [**aggregate functions**](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/group-by-having-count), which perform calculations based on sets of rows.  In this tutorial, you'll learn how to define **analytic functions**, which also operate on a set of rows.  However, unlike aggregate functions, analytic functions return a (potentially different) value for each row in the original table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analytic functions allow us to perform complex calculations with relatively straightforward syntax.  For instance, we can quickly calculate moving averages and running totals, among other quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how to write analytic functions, we'll work with a small table containing data from two different people who are training for a race.  The `id` column identifies each runner, the `date` column holds the day of the training session, and `time` shows the time (in minutes) that the runner dedicated to training.  Say we'd like to calculate a moving average of the training times for each runner, where we always take the average of the current and previous training sessions.  We can do this with the following query:\n",
    "\n",
    "![first_query](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/rehp8HM.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "All analytic functions have an **OVER** clause, which defines the sets of rows used in each calculation.  The **OVER** clause has three (optional) parts:\n",
    "- The **PARTITION BY** clause divides the rows of the table into different groups.  In the query above, we divide by `id` so that the calculations are separated by runner.\n",
    "- The **ORDER BY** clause defines an ordering within each partition.  In the sample query, ordering by the `date` column ensures that earlier training sessions appear first.\n",
    "- The final clause (`ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`) is known as a **window frame** clause.  It identifies the set of rows used in each calculation.  We can refer to this group of rows as a **window**.  (_Actually, analytic functions are sometimes referred to as **analytic window functions** or simply **window functions**!_)  \n",
    "\n",
    "![first_query](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/learn/images/GjiKlA7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "# (More on) window frame clauses\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to write window frame clauses:\n",
    "- `ROWS BETWEEN 1 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW` - the previous row and the current row.\n",
    "- `ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND 1 FOLLOWING` - the 3 previous rows, the current row, and the following row.  \n",
    "- `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING` - all rows in the partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this is not an exhaustive list, and you can imagine that there are many more options!  In the code below, you'll see some of these clauses in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Three types of analytic functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The example above uses only one of many analytic functions.  BigQuery supports a wide variety of analytic functions, and we'll explore a few here. For a complete listing, you can take a look at the [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/analytic-function-concepts).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Analytic aggregate functions\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might recall, **AVG()** (from the example above) is an aggregate function.  The **OVER** clause is what ensures that it's treated as an analytic (aggregate) function.  **Aggregate functions** take all of the values within the window as input and return a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MIN()** (or **MAX()**) - Returns the minimum (or maximum) of input values\n",
    "- **AVG()** (or **SUM()**) - Returns the average (or sum) of input values \n",
    "- **COUNT()** - Returns the number of rows in the input\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Analytic navigation functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Navigation functions** assign a value based on the value in a (usually) different row than the current row.\n",
    "- **FIRST_VALUE()** (or **LAST_VALUE()**) - Returns the first (or last) value in the input\n",
    "- **LEAD()** (and **LAG()**) - Returns the value on a subsequent (or preceding) row\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Analytic numbering functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numbering functions** assign integer values to each row based on the ordering.\n",
    "- **ROW_NUMBER()** - Returns the order in which rows appear in the input (starting with `1`)\n",
    "- **RANK()** - All rows with the same value in the ordering column receive the same rank value, where the next row receives a rank value which increments by the number of rows with the previous rank value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll work with the [San Francisco Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasf/san-francisco) dataset.  We begin by reviewing the first several rows of the `bikeshare_trips` table.  (_The corresponding code is hidden, but you can un-hide it by clicking on the \"Code\" button below._)"
